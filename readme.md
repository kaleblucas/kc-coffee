&Overview
This is an attempt to make transparent the cafes, the suppliers, the farms, etc. It's the cafe's responsibility
to make sure their coffee is ethically sourced from farms that benefit their communities. We hope to make the public
aware if they do by catalogging the logistic chain from plant to cafe (farms to coffees, coffees to cafes) There are
200 cafes in KC, and not everyone will participate, but we want to be a core resource in identifying the areas that
are least transparent in the coffee-to-cup logistic chain. By doing so, we can rest assured that the farmers putting
their time and care into the product are supported for the long-term.
