**Overview**
 
This is an attempt to make transparent the cafes, the suppliers, the farms, etc. It's the cafe's responsibility to make sure their coffee is ethically sourced from farms that benefit their communities. We hope to make the public aware if they do by cataloging the logistic chain from plant to cafe (farms to coffees, coffees to cafes) There are 200 cafes in KC, and not everyone will participate, but we want to be a core resource in identifying the areas that are least transparent in the coffee-to-cup logistic chain. By doing so, we can rest assured that the farmers putting their time and care into the product are supported for the long-term.

> After a short hiatus, I'm returning to this project with a fresh mind and intentions of broadening scope. Today, we're tackling wireframing. The original design for the UX seemed clunky, outdated, and difficult to optimize for mobile:

> These concepts relied too heavily on a widescreen format, and weren't designed with common user experience in mind. They focused on navigation to direct you to the content rather than present it upfront. This could lead to quick user fatigue or disinterest in the website entirely. After conversations with my "in-house designer" and some glances at popular websites. We modified the format.

>Alas, an experience that's easier to navigate and clearer to the user. We may pull design elements from previous ideas, but implement them in such a way that their usage is more intuitive and remains aware of  usage trends.
