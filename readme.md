**Overview**
This is an attempt to make transparent the cafes, the suppliers, the farms, etc. It's the cafe's responsibility to make sure their coffee is ethically sourced from farms that benefit their communities. We hope to make the public aware if they do by cataloging the logistic chain from plant to cafe (farms to coffees, coffees to cafes) There are 200 cafes in KC, and not everyone will participate, but we want to be a core resource in identifying the areas that are least transparent in the coffee-to-cup logistic chain. By doing so, we can rest assured that the farmers putting their time and care into the product are supported for the long-term.
